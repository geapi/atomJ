# AtomJ
After using IntelliJ and it's keybindings for years it is hard to switch to an editor with a new set of keybindings.

**Meet**: [IntelliJ keybindings](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard_Mac.pdf) combined with [Pivotal's additions](https://github.com/Pivotal-Boulder/IDE-Preferences) for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor.

You can read more about Atom keymaps [here](https://atom.io/docs/v0.60.0/advanced/keymaps).

# Usage

In order to use the keymap from this repo it needs to be in your `.atom` folder in your home directory.
You can use the commands below to achieve this, you might have to remove the `keymap.cson` from your `.atom` directory before doing so.
```
git clone git@github.com:VoronaPavel/atomJ.git
ln -s [path-to-atomJ-repo]/keymap.cson ~/.atom/keymap.cson
```
